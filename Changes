	  (So pugs can parse Perl 5, eep)
	- Latin-1/Unicode improvements (but now requires perl >= 5.8.5)
	  (not pre-checked and enforced yet, but will be)
	- Starting new generation of "exhaustive" testing

	Details:

	  detectably-failing 3-or-less character long Perl programs

	  (there may be a few more similar cases)
	- Fixed bug with $'0 (where 0 is only legal after ::)
	- No longer die for illegal chars in hex/bin number types
	  (Attach the error to $token->{_warning} instead)

	  (Both at EOF and end of token)
	- Convert [^\W\d]\w* to (?!\d)\w+ to improve unicode support
	  in symbols etc (Audrey Tang)
	- Miscellaneous doc bugs in the SYNOPSIS (Audrey Tang)

1.104    Thu Nov 10 2005

0.814 Sat Jun 26 2004
	- Added the PPI tester, a desktop-based interactive debugger, which
	  should greatly accelerate finding and fixing both ::Tokenizer

	  distribution though, as it has a dependency on wxPerl.

	- Fixed the misparsing of *100
	- Fixed the misparsing of Class::->method properly, or rather Foo::
	- Tokenizer correctly identifies labels
	- Changed PPI::Statement::Flow to PPI::Statement::Compound
	- Removed the extra null whitespace token appearing after a bareword
	  at the end of a file.
	- -X operator are recognised correctly, although not at end of file
	- Lexer detects subroutine and if () statement ends correctly

0.811 Mon Jun 21 2004
	- Added support for subroutine attributes
	- Fixed some problems with anonymous subroutines and prototypes
	- $#$foo parses as (Cast,Symbol) now, not (Magic,Symbol)

	- Recognise the _ magic filehandle

0.809 Sat Apr 17 2004

	- The $} magic variable is now supported
	- Fixed a "tight sub property" bug ( sub foo:lvalue )

0.805 Sun Sep 28 2003
	- The maximum line length regressed, reseting it to 5000.
	- In PPI::Format::HTML, not any parsing error causing a
	  premature end of tokenizer by adding it in a comment at
	  the end of the file.

0.804 Sat Sep 06 2003
	- Statement and Structure resolution preliminarily work.
	  Some basic types of statements and structures are identified.
	- PPI::Format::Apache has been separated into a different module

0.803 Sat Sep 06 2003
	- Added very long line protection support.
	  Maximum line length is now 5000.

	  mostly OK again, without adding broken duplicate tokens.
	- Added the PPI::Lexer::Dump module, to do Lexer object dumps.

0.802 Sat Aug 23 2003
	- PPI::Format::HTML sends the correct content headers

0.801 Fri Aug 22 2003
